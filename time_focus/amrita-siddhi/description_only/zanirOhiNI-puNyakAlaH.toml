When Rohini nakshatra falls on a Saturday, it is a special `puNyakAlaH`. In the cyclic rotation of time, along with the bad combinations of grahas and nakshatras that indicate the probability of upcoming difficulties, good combinations that grant benefits in multiples also arise. Among such good combinations are the Amrita Siddhi yogas of certain weekdays and nakshatras. They are Sunday-Hasta, Monday-Mrigashirsha, Tuesday-Ashvini, Wednesday-Anuradha, Thursday-Pushya, Friday-Revati, Saturday-Rohini. Good deeds performed on such yogas become especially strong in protecting and nourishing us.
For instance, in Devi Atharvashirsha, it is said `bhaumAzvinyAM mahAdevI-sannidhau japtvA mahAmRtyuM tarati`, that is, one can cross even `mahAmRtyu` by doing parayanam when Tuesday and Ashvini join.
