en = """The Adhikara Nandi festival a special day within the larger Panguni Utsavam, the 10-day annual festival celebrated at the Sri Kapaleeshwarar Temple in Mylapore, Chennai. The festival celebrates the divine bull Nandi, the mount of Bhagavan Shiva. [Image of Nandi, the mount of Bhagavan Shiva]
Adhigara translates to "Supreme Bull" or "King of Bulls", highlighting Nandi's importance as Shiva's loyal companion and vahanam.

On the morning of the third day of the Panguni Utsavam, Bhagavan Kapaleeshwarar, the presiding deity of the temple, is adorned in special ornaments and taken out in a procession mounted on a silver-plated Nandi. The procession winds through the "Mada" streets of Mylapore, accompanied by devotional music, chants, and enthusiastic devotees.

The sight of the majestic silver Nandi adorned with flowers and jewels, carrying Bhagavan Kapaleeshwarar, is a mesmerising spectacle. Devotees throng the streets to witness the procession, shower blessings, and participate in the joyous celebrations. The procession culminates in the temple complex, where special rituals and pujas are performed for Bhagavan Kapaleeshwarar and Nandi."""
