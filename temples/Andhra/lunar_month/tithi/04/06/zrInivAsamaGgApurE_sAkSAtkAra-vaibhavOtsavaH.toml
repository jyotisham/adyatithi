The temple of Sri Kalyana Venkateshwara Swamy, which has been a center of devotion from ancient times, once fell into disrepair. It was later renovated by Chinna Tirumalacharya, the grandson of Sri Tallapaka Annamacharya, as evidenced by an inscription dated March 22nd, 1510 CE at the temple's entrance. Despite regaining its glory for several years, the temple again faced neglect in the 20th century.

In 1940, an Archaka named Sri Sundara Raja Swamy from Kanchi, inspired by a dream in which Sri Kalyana Venkateshwara Swamy appeared, took it upon himself to clean the temple premises and resume regular pujas. He conveyed his dream to the villagers, narrating how Shri Venkateshwara Swamy manifested in the dream and instructed him to restore the temple's former splendor (Past Vaibhavam) by conducting Deepa Naivedya Aaradhana, after which the Bhagavan vanished from the dream. On July 11, 1940, which was Ashada Shukla Paksha Shashti, Sundara Raja Swamy conducted a special puja, marking the day the deity revealed his divine form to devotees. This event led the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams to initiate the annual "Sakshatkara Vaibhavotsavams."

"Sakshatkaram" refers to the deity's holy appearance or Darshan. The Sakshatkara Vaibhavotsavam is a three-day festival that includes the day of the deity’s appearance (Ashada Suddha Shasti) and the days immediately before and after. The first day of the celebration includes a procession of the deity, Sri Kalyana Venkateshwara Swamy, along with His consorts, on the Pedda Shesha Vahanam, from the temple to the Kalyana Mandapa, followed by Abhishekam and Unjal Seva in the evening. The second day features Hanumantha Vahana Seva, and the third day concludes with the Garuda Vahana Seva at night. These celebrations provide devotees the opportunity to witness the deity and receive blessings.
