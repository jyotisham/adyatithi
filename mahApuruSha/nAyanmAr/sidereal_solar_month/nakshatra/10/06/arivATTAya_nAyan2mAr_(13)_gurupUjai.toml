[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

In Kannamangalam, a part of the Chola kingdom, there was a wealthy Vellala named Thayanar who exemplified the ideal householder life, as praised by the Nayanmar Tiruvalluvar. Thayanar was a devoted follower of Bhagavan Shiva, expressing his devotion through a daily ritual of offering food made of red rice, a red herb sauce, and mango pickle to the deity. This humble offering was a symbol of his deep faith.

However, Thayanar's faith was to be tested by Bhagavan Shiva. Suddenly, he found himself in poverty, and despite this, he continued his ritual by working and earning red rice as wages. He maintained his devotion by consuming inferior khar rice, reserving the red rice solely for the deity. Further testing Thayanar's devotion, all fields in the area began to produce only red rice, but Thayanar refrained from consuming it, instead eating green leaves from his garden. When even these leaves withered away, Thayanar subsisted on water alone, his focus unwavering from his worship.

One day, while weak and emaciated, Thayanar fell while carrying his offering to Bhagavan Shiva, spilling it on the ground. Distraught, he believed he had committed a grave sin and begged for Bhagavan's forgiveness, threatening to end his own life with a sickle if Bhagavan did not accept his spilled offering. This extreme act of devotion touched Bhagavan Shiva, who intervened just as Thayanar was about to harm himself. Thayanar heard the sound of the deity eating the mango pickle, realizing the divine play at hand. Bhagavan Shiva and Mother Parvati then appeared before him, commending his extraordinary devotion and promising him and his wife a place in the divine abode."""
