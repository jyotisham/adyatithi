[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Pusalar Nayanmar, named thus because he was always smeared with bhasma (`pUcu` meaning apply/smear), was a Brahmana from Tiru Ninravur in Thondai Mandalam, and a firm believer in the power of mental worship of Bhagavan Shiva, which he considered superior to external rituals. Despite his desire to build a physical temple for Bhagavan Shiva, his lack of funds led him to construct a temple in his mind, meticulously planning each detail and even setting an auspicious date for the deity's installation.

Coincidentally, a Kadava king, also a devotee of Bhagavan Shiva, had constructed an actual temple in Kanchipuram --- the Kailasanathar temple (https://maps.app.goo.gl/s8atsoeX7L5hNNf79) --- and planned the deity's installation on the same date as Pusalar's mental ceremony. In a dream, Bhagavan Shiva instructed the king to postpone his temple's ceremony as He was to be present in Pusalar's temple at Tiru Ninravur. Intrigued and eager to witness this exceptional temple, the king travelled to Tiru Ninravur but found no physical structure. Upon meeting Pusalar, the king learned that the temple existed only in Pusalar's mind! Not only that, he was able to witness the Kumbhabhisheka activities including Veda parayanam and other ceremonial activities. Deeply moved by Pusalar's profound devotion, the king revered him. Pusalar, feeling immensely blessed by Bhagavan Shiva's acknowledgment of his mental temple, continued his worship, eventually attaining divine union with Bhagavan. The king then also materialized the temple that Pusalar had built in his heart before having the temple built by himself duly consecrated! He called the deity ‘Hridayaleshwarar’ (https://maps.app.goo.gl/tnpnMUPwDUnKCfAa9), the one who abides in the heart. 

Historically, Pusalar is dated to the 8th century CE, contemporary to King Rajasimha (Narasimhavarman II), who reigned from 700 to 728 CE. Rajasimha's greatest temple, the Kailasanathar temple in Kanchipuram, identified as the king's temple from the tale, is linked to Pusalar through inscriptions. These inscriptions, especially a verse mentioning a “heavenly voice without body”, connect to the story of Pusalar and Bhagavan Shiva's voice, positioning Pusalar as a historical figure of that era."""
