[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Satti Nayanmar, born into a Vellala family, hailed from Varinjiyur in the Chola kingdom. He was deeply devoted to Bhagavan Shiva and held great respect for the Bhagavan's devotees. Satti Nayanmar was so committed to honoring these devotees that he could not bear to hear any slander against them. In his zeal to protect their dignity, he would go to the extreme measure of cutting out the tongue of anyone who spoke ill of Bhagavan Shiva's devotees. Recognizing the purity and intensity of Satti Nayanmar's devotion, Bhagavan Shiva bestowed his divine grace upon him."""
