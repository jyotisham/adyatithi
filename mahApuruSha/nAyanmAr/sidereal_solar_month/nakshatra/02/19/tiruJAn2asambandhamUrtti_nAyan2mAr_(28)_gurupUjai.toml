Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar (Thirunavukkarasar), Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavachakar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

The 28th of the Nayanmars, Thirugnana Sambandar, born to a devout Brahmana couple---Shivapada Hridayar and Bhagavatiar---in 7th-century Sirkazhi, was an answer to his father's prayers for a son who would revive the glory of Shaivism. At the age of three, during a visit to the Sattainathar Shiva Temple, Sambandar was left by his parents near a pond. While alone, he began to cry and was comforted and fed by Devi Parvati and Bhagavan Shiva, appearing as Thoniappar. His parents found milk on his lips and upon questioning, Sambandar pointed skyward and spontaneously composed his first hymn, “Thodudaiya Seviyan”, symbolizing his reception of divine wisdom or Shivajnanam. This event marked him as Thirugnana Sambandar, the Nayanmar of divine knowledge, and Aludaiya Pillayar, the Bhagavan’s child.

Celebrated as Tala Vendan, the unrivaled master of rhythm in the Periyapuranam, Sambandar demonstrated prodigious talents from a young age. By the time he was seven, he began singing about the Vedas and authored a significant collection of hymns, forming volumes 1-3 of the Thirumurai.

Sambandar, from an early age, showed remarkable spiritual gifts, composing and singing hymns in praise of Bhagavan Shiva, now known as Thevaram. During a pilgrimage, he met Tiru Neelakanta Yazhpanar (the 61st of the Nayanmars), an expert musician, who became his constant companion. Sambandar's journey was filled with miraculous events --- he was given a pair of golden cymbals by Bhagavan Shiva, received a pearl palanquin from the Bhagavan to ease his travels, and his divine hymns healed the sick and performed wonders.

In Madurai, dominated by Jainism, Sambandar played a crucial role in re-establishing Shaivism. He miraculously cured the Jain king of a burning ailment using sacred ash and defeated the Jains in various spiritual challenges. His actions led to the king embracing Shaivism and the resurgence of the faith in the region.

Sambandar’s life was marked by his profound devotion and the numerous miracles he performed. He brought a merchant's dead daughter back to life and helped many others through his spiritual powers. As his wedding approached at the age of 16, Sambandar prayed to Shiva for liberation. During his wedding, a miraculous blaze of light, the Shiva Jyoti, appeared. As he recited the “Panchakshara Padigam”, everyone present --- including Tiruneelanakka Nayanmar, Muruga Nayanmar and Tiruneelakanta Yazhpanar --- were absorbed into a divine light, merging with Bhagavan Shiva! His legacy continues to influence and inspire Shaivite devotion and music."""
