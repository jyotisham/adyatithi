[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Tiru Neelakanta Yazhpanar was a devout follower of Bhagavan Shiva from Tiru Erukattanpuliyur in the Chola kingdom. Renowned for his skill in playing the Yazh, a traditional musical instrument similar to the Veena, he traveled to various sacred shrines to sing praises of the Bhagavan. During a visit to Madura, he stood at the temple entrance, playing and singing. Bhagavan Shiva, desiring to hear Yazhpanar’s music more closely, communicated through dreams to his devotees to invite Yazhpanar into the inner shrine.

The next day, the Brahmanas led Yazhpanar into the shrine. Surprised but understanding this as Bhagavan Shiva's divine play, Yazhpanar played the Yazh with even greater fervor. Miraculously, a heavenly voice suggested providing a golden seat to avoid damaging the instrument on the wet floor. Yazhpanar was then offered a golden seat, where he continued his devotional singing, expressing gratitude for the Bhagavan’s compassion.

Later, Yazhpanar visited Tiruvarur. Here, too, he initially sang outside the shrine. In response to his devotion, Bhagavan Shiva created a new opening on the northern side of the temple specifically for Yazhpanar. Recognizing this as another divine gesture, Yazhpanar entered through the gate and sang in the immediate presence of the Bhagavan. 

His journey with Sambandar and eventual attainment of Liberation is of note: During a pilgrimage, Sambandar met Tiru Neelakanta Yazhpanar, who became his constant companion.  As his wedding approached at age 16, Sambandar prayed to Shiva for liberation. During this time, a miraculous blaze of light, the Shiva Jyoti, appeared. As he recited the “Panchakshara Padigam”, everyone present --- including Tiruneelanakka Nayanmar, Muruga Nayanmar and Tiruneelakanta Yazhpanar --- were absorbed into a divine light, merging with Bhagavan Shiva! His legacy continues to influence and inspire Shaivite devotion and music."""
