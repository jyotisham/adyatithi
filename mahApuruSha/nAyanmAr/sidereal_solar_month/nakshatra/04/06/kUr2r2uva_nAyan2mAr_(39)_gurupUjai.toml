[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

This Nayanmar, a chieftain from Kalandai, was a fervent devotee of Bhagavan Shiva. His daily spiritual practices included the repetition of the Panchakshara Mantra and the service of Shiva Bhaktas. Recognizing his devotion, Bhagavan Shiva blessed him with increased power, wealth, and strength. The Nayanmar's influence grew to such an extent that he conquered many regions within the Chola and Pandyan kingdoms. He expressed a desire to be crowned king by the three thousand Brahmanas of Tillai, but they declined, owing their allegiance to the Chola king. This led to the Brahmanas leaving Tillai to avoid the Nayanmar's anger, leaving only one to perform Puja in the temple. Even this lone Brahmana refused to crown him. In response to his prayers, Bhagavan Shiva personally appeared and crowned the Nayanmar, placing His divine Feet upon his head, symbolizing a spiritual coronation. The Nayanmar continued his devout worship of Bhagavan Shiva and ultimately achieved union with Him, demonstrating that his request for coronation was not for political power, but for spiritual affirmation and blessings from Bhagavan."""
