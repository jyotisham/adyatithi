[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Kotpuli Nayanmar, born in a Vellala family, was the Commander-in-Chief for a Chola king, and a devout follower of Bhagavan Shiva. He religiously bought paddy with his income to donate for the Bhagavan's offerings in Shiva temples. Before leaving for a military assignment, he left a considerable amount of paddy, specifically designated for temple use, with his family. However, during a famine in his absence, his relatives, suffering from hunger, used this paddy for themselves. Upon returning and discovering this, the Nayanmar, deeply upset by their disregard for his instructions and their disrespect towards the Bhagavan, killed them, including his own parents. His devotion to Bhagavan Shiva surpassed even his familial bonds. In response, Bhagavan Shiva appeared to the Nayanmar, blessing him and granting salvation to him and all the relatives who perished by his hand."""
