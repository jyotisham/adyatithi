[description]
en = """Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

Murkha Nayanmar, a Vellala from Tiruverkat in Thondai Nadu, was a fervent devotee of Bhagavan Shiva. He devoted himself to Maahesvara Puja, in the form of generously feeding the devotees of Shiva. In his dedication, he expended all his wealth on this practice.

Faced with financial depletion, he adopted an unconventional method. He engaged in gambling, solely to finance the feeding of Shiva's devotees. Driven by his devotion, he ventured beyond his village, seeking gambling opportunities. His determination was fierce; he would not hesitate to use force if someone declined to gamble with him. This earned him the moniker 'Murkha Nayanmar', implying a somewhat misguided or reckless devotee. However, he never used his gambling gains for personal gain, dedicating everything to the service of the Bhagavan's devotees. This reflects his profound devotion, a state where the devotee is wholly absorbed in God, almost oblivious to worldly norms."""
