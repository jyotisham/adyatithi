Between the 6th and 9th centuries, in South India, there existed 63 ardent devotees of Bhagavan Shiva, collectively known as the Nayanmars. These devout individuals, hailing from various walks of life including potters, fishermen, farmers, merchants, priests, hunters, and washermen, created devotional songs still sung by followers around the globe. Among these Nayanmars, Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar, known for their Thevaram hymns, along with Manikkavasagar, are distinguished as the Samayacharyas or the ‘The Four’ (`nAlvar`) revered teachers of the faith. They were instrumental in promoting the Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy and culture, effectively challenging the spread of Jainism and Buddhism. Their teachings centered around the concept that Shiva embodies love, and that embracing love for all beings and existence is essential in connecting with Shiva, the Supreme Being.

The 4th of the Nayanmars was Ilayankudi Mara Nayanmar, a farmer named Maranar from the village of Ilayankudi. He was a devout follower of Bhagavan Shiva and His devotees. He practiced Maaheswara Puja, a form of worship involving honouring and serving Bhagavan Shiva's devotees with utmost reverence, as if serving Bhagavan Himself. This included welcoming devotees, washing their feet, offering them food, and treating them with great respect and kindness.

Though Nayanmar was blessed with wealth, he believed his riches were meant to serve Bhagavan's devotees. His devotion remained steadfast even as his wealth dwindled. Eventually, he sold all his possessions and even himself to continue serving the devotees.

One rainy day, with no food at home, Nayanmar and his wife were visited by a Shiva Bhakta. Despite their own hunger, they welcomed the devotee warmly. Nayanmar's wife suggested gathering the grain-seeds they had recently sown to prepare a meal. After they fed the devotee and Nayanmar went to check on him, he found the devotee had vanished. Instead, Bhagavan Shiva and Mother Parvathy appeared in the sky, revealing that the devotee was Bhagavan Shiva in disguise. They blessed Nayanmar and his wife for their unwavering devotion and promised them eternal life in the divine abode. This story exemplifies the profound impact of selfless service and devotion to the Supreme and His devotees.
