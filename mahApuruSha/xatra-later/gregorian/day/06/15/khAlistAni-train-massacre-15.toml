On this day, sikh khAlistAnis massacred about a 100 hindus in two trains in Punjab.

June 15, 1991. 9:35 PM, A train slows near Baddowal, Ludhiana. Terrorists hotwired the signal system to stop it. Then, like demons in the dark, they stormed in with Automatic rifles. AK-47s. And one deadly question: “Are you Hindu?”  
62 passengers, mostly Hindus, were gunned down.
 40 more injured.
Bodies slumped over benches. Mothers shielding children. Blood flooding the aisles.

Different train near Qila Rajan, Ludhiana.
Terrorists boarded the Dhuri-Hisar passenger train.
This time, the attack was even more methodical.
They separated Hindus from Sikhs. Forced the Hindus off the train.
Then, like animals, lined them up on the tracks… and shot them dead.
 48 killed. 30 injured.

That same day, Khalistani terrorists assassinated Jatinder Singh, an Assembly candidate from the All-India Sikh Students Federation (AISSF), inside a gurdwara in Ropar.
He became the 21st political candidate killed in cold blood.

**Context**  
Punjab was already burning.
By mid-June 1991, over 700 civilians had been killed in the run-up to elections. Army had been deployed. The State was under President’s Rule since 1987.
