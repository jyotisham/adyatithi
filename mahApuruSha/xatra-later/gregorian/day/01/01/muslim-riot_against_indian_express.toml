An article in the Bangalore edition of The New Indian Express on New Years Day so upset the Muslim community in the city that the next day a 1,000-strong mob stormed the newspaper's building in protest. ... But the angry crowd had already burnt down a lorry laden with newsprint for The New Indian Express before that; and the news of the incident spread to other parts of the city. Several policemen were injured in violence. - India Today

## Context (India Today summary)
The community was venting its anger at an unflattering reference to the Prophet by 13th century Italian poet Dante in the literary work Inferno which was quoted by the daily's editorial adviser T.J.S. George in his cover essay "The Millennium is Dead . . . Long Live the Millennium" - a diatribe against the West-led Church's alleged hegemony over the East.


## Aftermath (India Today summary)
A 20-member delegation of Muslim scholars led by the Bangalore Jama Masjid imam met the chief reporter of the newspaper and demanded an apology by George and a regret note from the paper, which was frontpaged by the daily the next day.

In the apology titled "Instigated Violence" the newspaper said the protests were organised by disgruntled elements "for reasons other than defence of faith". "We will continue to respect all religions and their divine personages including Islam and its Prophet. We only hope that the Muslim community will get a better and more enlightened leadership which will work for the community and not their own advancement." ...

While the writer of that story, P.K.N. Namboodiri, had embarked on a pilgrimage to Sabarimala in the midst of the controversy, George, founder editor of the Hong Kong-based Asiaweek magazine, went underground.
