5 jihAdi-s murdered over 27 Hindu male tourists in Baisaran valley, Pahalgam, Anantnag at around 2:30 PM. These included a Navy officer and an IB officer. A local poney operator who tried to help was killed.

They confirmed Hindu religion by making them recite Islamic kalima verse, checking ID cards, looking for uncircumcised penises.  
When a wife asked to be killed like her husband, she was told that an she was being spared so she could "narrate the horrors" to PM Narendra Modi.

The place could only be accessed by pony - so it was chosen. The attackers had stocked up dry fruits and medicines. They did a recce of Pahalgam with the help of some locals.
