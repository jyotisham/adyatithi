On the morning of 30 April 
1982, 17 Ananda Marga sannyasa—16 sadhus and 1 sadhvi—were dragged out of taxis en route to an educational conference at the Ananda Marga's headquarters in Tiljala, Kolkata by communists. They were beaten to death and simultaneously set on fire in three locations. It was reported that the murders took place in broad daylight and were witnessed by thousands of people.

The communist chief minister Jyoti Basu claimed that they killed themselves to embarass his government.
