On this day a big massacre of Hindus by Islamist mobs began in the mUlAdi river port in East Pakistan. On the morning of 17th, terrified Hindus and Christians began to rush towards the Muladi police station. The O.C. however refused to provide any shelter.

In the betelnut orchard of one Hindu, more 300 dead bodies were found.

In the meantime, the Ansars went all around Muladi announcing in loudspeakers asking the Hindus to assemble at the Muladi police station. After the Hindus and Christians had gathered hundreds of non-Muslim men were massacred within the precincts of the police station.  The O.C. himself stripped the Hindu women of their vermillion and conch shell bangles and forced them to recite the kalma. Later he distributed the women among the gang leaders.
