[description]
en = "By His yoga shakti, Shri Shankara Bhagavatpada went to Kailasa. There, Samba Parameshvara blessed Him with five sphatika linga-s by name Yoga, Bhoga, Vara, Siddhi and Mukti (and called Chandramaulishvara) and Saundarya Lahari, the Devi stotra par excellence. Bhagavan ordained to Bhagavatpada that puja should be done thrice daily to the linga-s with different kinds of abhisheka and naivedya, for the world to attain all shreyas. Among those lingas, the Yoga Linga idol is worshipped by our Kamakoti Acharyas themselves, and Devi Mahātripurasundari is worshipped as a Shrichakra Meru. Shri Bhagavatpāda installed the other linga-s at Kedara, Nepal, Tungabhadra Sangama and Chidambara. This is known by many pramana grantha-s such as Shiva Rahasya and Markandeya Samhitā. The Shrimatham tradition is that Chandramaulishvara came to us on Magha Shukla Panchami, and therefore, there is a special naivedyam performed on this occasion in Shri Matham."
