[description]
en = "As per the saying “gurum prakāshayed dhīmān”, Shri Jayendra Sarasvati Shricharana installed the vigraha of Shri Bhagavatpada in all the Jyotirlinga Kshetras that He had extolled. Further He installed the divine form of Shri Bhagavatpada, the Jagadguru, in the four extremes of Bhārat—Jagannatha, Kanyakumari, Gokarna seashores and Kailasa—facing the respective directions. As per the wishes of His Guru Shri Chandrashekharendra Sarasvati Shricharana, He consoled the Sanatanis of the Kashmira Desha driven away from there, and took up laukika/vaidika efforts for their welfare. Even in the North-East end of Bharat, He likewise did pratishtha of Shri Bhagavatpada and conducted laukika/vaidika dharma-s so that difficulty should not befall Sanatana Dharma. He attained siddhi on Kumbha Phalguna Shukla Trayodashi in Hemalamba year in the forenoon (2018-02-28). The adhishthanam is in the premises of Kanchi Matham at https://maps.app.goo.gl/GqcNJ87GrkU2o4RB9."
